This file contains instructions for how to build Ultracoin for Ubuntu on Ubuntu Server 12.04 using
Oracle VirtualBox. When completed, you will be able to build the static loaded Ultracoind using the
tested versions of libraries Ultracoin needs to run properly. A fresh install of Ubuntu Server 12.04 is
used so as to have a consistent build environment UN-tarnished by system changes.

NOTE: Since this is targeted for Ubuntu Server 12.04, these instructions will not coverer how to
build the GUI version of Ultracoin. The windows version of the GUI gets much more attention from
developers, so if you want to use the GUI, running the Windows version is recommended.

NOTE: The makefile for these instructions is found in src/makefile.ubuntu

Why would you want to build Ultracoin this way?

      1 - It can be frustrating to build Ultracoin for the first time. This will work every time.

      2 - Web servers usually have lots of added programs, libraries and configurations. Building
      Ultracoin this way makes sure your Ultracoin build is UN-tarnished.

      3 - Ultracoin must be statically built with specific versions of libraries that are not usually
      included in Ubuntu.

      4 - Having your own Ubuntu build of Ultracoin is a great way to enable web based Ultracoin services
      that are built on Ubuntu servers to interact with Ultracoin.

      5 - A stand alone VirtualBox running Ubuntu server 12.04 is a also a great way to run Ultracoin
      in a secure environment, where it becomes much harder for anybody to steel your Ultracoin. This
      might be especially important if you have a large stockpile of Ultracoin that you like to get
      Proof of Stake (POS) rewards from.

      6 - Developing and debugging Ultracoin may be easier for those who are more familiar with a Linux
      environment, and developers need to use the correct libraries to be productive.

      7 - People who use Linux love to build stuff from scratch!

NOTE: these instructions were developed using Windows 7 on a 64 bit machine as the VirtualBox host.
Of course any computer that can run VirtualBox can be used.

Section A - Get Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 running inside VirtualBox with OpenSHH Server.

      1 - If you don't already have VirtualBox installed, download and install the latest VirtualBox
      from http://www.virtualbox.org. Click on Downloads and get the binary installer for Windows
      hosts.

      2 - Download Ubuntu Server 12.04.3 LTS 64 bit from http://www.ubuntu.com. Click
      Download->Server at the top. Select 64-bit and click "Get Ubuntu 12.04 LTS".

      3 - Create a virtual machine in VirtualBox. Click New. Give the VM a name, like "Ultracoin
      builder". Select "Linux" as the type and "Ubuntu (64 bit)" as the version. Click "Next". Give
      the virtual machine at least 1024 MB of memory. Click "Next". Click "Create" to create a new
      virtual hard drive. Click "Next" to use VDI hard drive type. Click "Next" to use Dynamically
      allocated. Click "Create" to create a hard drive with 8.00 GB of space.

      5 - Before firing up the virtual machine, we want to bridge the network interface so that
      we can SSH to it easily. Click on "Ultracoin builder" and hit the "Settings" button. Click
      on "Network". Change the "Attached to:" to "Bridged Adapter". Click "OK". Then we want to
      load our CD image of Ubuntu Server 12.0.4.3. Still in "Settings", click "Storage". Under
      "Controller: IDE" click "Empty". Then click the picture of a CD to the right and select
      "Choose a virtual CD/DVD disk file...". Navigate and select the downloaded ubuntu image file
      "ubuntu-12.04.3-server-amd64.iso". Click "OK" to get out of "Settings". Click "Start" to fire
      up the virtual machine.

      6 - Click the window that pops up and let the window capture your mouse. You can get your
      mouse back at any time by hitting the right Ctrl key on your keyboard. Hit enter to accept
      English. Hit enter to "Install Ubuntu Server". Hit enter for English again. Use your arrow
      keys to select your country and hit enter. Use the tab key to move the cursor around. Hit
      enter to skip detect keyboard layout. Hit enter to use English keyboard. Hit enter to use
      English keyboard layout. After a few minutes of loading, choose your hostname. Leaving as
      "ubuntu" is OK. Tab, then enter to accept host name. Type a user name (like "yacbuild"). Tab
      and enter to continue. Tab and enter again to use "yacbuild" as account name. Make a password.
      Don't forget the user name and password! Tab and enter to continue. Verify password, tab and
      enter to continue. Hit enter to not encrypt home directory. NOTE: If you intend on using
      this server to store lots of Ultracoin, you may choose to encrypt your home directory for extra
      security. Hit enter to accept your time zone. Hit enter to select "Guided - use entire disk
      and set up LVM". Hit enter to select select disk to partition. Tab to "Yes" and hit enter to
      "Write changes to disks and configure LVM". Tab and enter to use the whole disk. Tab then
      enter to "Write the changes to disks". After some time, tab and enter to not use a proxy server
      (unless you want to use a proxy server for your Internet connection). After some time, hit
      enter to select "No automatic updates". Hit the space bar to select "OpenSHH server". Tab and
      enter to accept OpenSSH server selection. After some time, hit enter to "Install the GRUB boot
      loader to the mater boot record". Don't worry, that will only effect the virtual machine. After
      some time, hit enter to reboot the virtual machine.

Section B - Updating Ubuntu Server 12.04.3

      1 - Login into the VirtualBox window running Ubuntu Server 12.04.3.

      2 - Type "sudo apt-get update" and enter your password to get the latest security updates.

      3 - Type "sudo apt-get upgrade" to install the latest security updates. Hit enter to accept
      the updates.

      4 - Type "sudo shutdown -P now" to shut down the virtual machine.

      5 - Now is a great time to make a snapshot of your virtual machine in case you want to start
      over from here. In the "Oracle VM VirtualBox Manager" window, click the icon that looks like a
      camera. Give the snapshot a name like "Fresh install with updates".

      6 - Start the virtual machine back up by clicking the green "Start" button.

Section C - Login to your virtual machine using SSH

The VirtualBox window running your virtual machine is small and clunky. We want to use the Putty SSH
client to login to the virtual machine because it is fast, beautiful, and the window can be resized.
Download Putty from http://www.putty.org. Get the putty.exe file for "Windows on Intel x86". It's
just an executable file. There is no need to install it. We need to find out the IP address of the
virtual machine, so login using the VirtualBox window.

      1 - Type " ifconfig ". In "eth0" is "inet addr:". That's the IP address of your virtual
      machine.

      2 - On your Windows host, start "putty.exe". Type your IP address into the "Host Name" box.
      Type a name like "yacbuild" into the "Saved Sessions" box and click "Save". Click "Open" to
      start the SSH terminal. Click "Yes" to accept the ssh-rsa fingerprint.

      3 - Login to your virtual machine using the SSH terminal. Now you can resize your window,
      which you can't do in the VirtualBox window!

Section D - Install required packages

      1 - Type " sudo apt-get install git " and enter your password to install git.
